# House Price Prediction

This project leverages machine learning to predict house prices using a dataset of house sales in Seattle, USA. The primary goal is to build a linear regression model that accurately predicts house prices based on various features.

## Project Structure

1. **Data Preparation:**
   - Loading the dataset `kc_house_data.csv`.
   - Exploring and processing the data to prepare relevant features for the model.
   - Visualizing data distributions and identifying outliers.

2. **Modeling:**
   - Using linear regression to build the price prediction model.
   - Splitting the dataset into training and testing sets.
   - Applying logarithmic transformation to certain features to improve model accuracy.

3. **Model Evaluation:**
   - Evaluating the model using metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and RÂ² Score.
   - Visualizing predictions against actual values.

4. **Deployment:**
   - Saving the trained model in `pkl` format for local deployment.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/Khalifasimboro/CodeAlpha_Project_Predictive-Modeling-with-Linear-Regression
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

1. Load the saved model (`model.pkl`).
2. Use the `pipeline` function to predict the price of a house based on its features.

## ML-Model-Flask-Deployment
This is a demo project to elaborate how Machine Learn Models are deployed on production using Flask API

### Prerequisites
You must have Scikit Learn, Pandas (for Machine Leraning Model) and Flask (for API) installed.

### Project Structure
This project has four major parts :
1. model.py - This contains code fot our Machine Learning model to predict employee salaries absed on trainign data in 'hiring.csv' file.
2. app.py - This contains Flask APIs that receives employee details through GUI or API calls, computes the precited value based on our model and returns it.
3. request.py - This uses requests module to call APIs already defined in app.py and dispalys the returned value.
4. templates - This folder contains the HTML template to allow user to enter employee detail and displays the predicted employee salary.
5. Source code : The notebook wich contain the code line of data processing and the creating of the model

### Running the project
1. Ensure that you are in the project home directory. Create the machine learning model by running below command -
```
python model.py
```
This would create a serialized version of our model into a file model.pkl

2. Run app.py using below command to start Flask API
```
python app.py
```
By default, flask will run on port 5000.

3. Navigate to URL http://localhost:5000

You should be able to view the homepage as below :

Enter valid numerical values in all 3 input boxes and hit Predict.

If everything goes well, you should  be able to see the predcited salary vaule on the HTML page!

4. You can also send direct POST requests to FLask API using Python's inbuilt request module
Run the beow command to send the request with some pre-popuated values -
```
python request.py
```
